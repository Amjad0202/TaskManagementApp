Task Management App

This is a simple console-based Java application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The app allows users to create tasks, list all tasks, and mark tasks as completed. It demonstrates key concepts of Java programming, including object-oriented design, collections, and user input handling.

Features
Add Task: Users can create a new task by providing a name and description.
List Tasks: View all tasks with their current status (completed or not completed).
Mark Task as Completed: Mark any task as completed by selecting the task from the list.
Future Enhancements
Data Persistence: Save tasks to a file (e.g., JSON, text, or database) so that tasks are stored even after the program is closed.
Task Deadlines: Add support for task deadlines and priorities.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implement a more user-friendly interface using JavaFX.
